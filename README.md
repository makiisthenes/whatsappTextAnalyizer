    - Find out how many messages where sent by person A and B;
    - Of these messages, the percentage of actual texts and images/stickers.
    - The amount of emojis used by each person.
    - [still in develpment] The type of emoji specifically and how many times.
    - The amount of times, user has initiated a conversation first.
